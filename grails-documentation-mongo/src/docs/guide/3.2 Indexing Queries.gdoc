Mongo doesn't require that you specify indices to query, but like a relational database without specifying indices your queries will be significantly slower.

With that in mind it is important to specify the properties you plan to query using the mapping block:

{code:java}
class Person {
	String name
	static mapping = {
		name index:true
	}
}
{code}

With the above mapping a Mongo index will be automatically created for you.
